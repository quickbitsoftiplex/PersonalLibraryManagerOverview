 # Steps to run the project
 1 - Clone the project anywhere on your machine
 2 - cd to the project's directory, there you should find 2 subfolders: Client and Server
 3 - cd to Server
 4 - run npm run init-server in order to install all the dependecies 
 5 - then run npm run init init in order to double check the dependencies and also install the client's dependencies
 6 - if you are on Mac, run npm run start-mac, otherwise just npm run start. I think on Linux the mac script will work just fine, i did not test that case.
 7 - now the services are running concurrently, enjoy
