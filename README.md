### Steps to Run the Project

Follow these steps to get the project running on your machine:

1. **Clone the project** anywhere on your machine.
2. **Navigate to the project's directory**, where you should find 2 subfolders: `Client` and `Server`.
3. Change directory to `Server` by running `cd Server`.
4. Run `npm run init-server` to install all the dependencies for the server.
5. Then, run `npm run init init` to double-check the server dependencies and also install the client's dependencies.
6. If you are on **Mac**, run `npm run start-mac`, otherwise, just run `npm run start`. On **Linux**, the Mac script should work just fine, though it was not tested in that environment.
7. Now the services are running concurrently, enjoy!
